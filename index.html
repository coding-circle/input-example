      <h1>Inputs!</h1>
      <p>
        These are generic text/data fields that come free with HTML. Definitely
        not exciting, but they are very useful for building applications. They
        come in several different "<a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types"
          >types</a
        >", and can be given default "values".
      </p>
      <label for="text-input">text input</label>
      <input id="text-input" type="text" value="Steamed Hams" />
      <p>
        This one is the default. Characters appear when you type if the input is
        in focus. The &lt;input&gt;'s internal value is updated as you enter
        characters. All inputs store their values inside "value" as text, but
        some store it in different text formats, and restrict the type of input
        they accept in different ways. Here are some common input types:
      </p>
      <label for="number-input">number input</label>
      <input id="number-input" type="number" value="69420" />
      <p>
        Typing a-z characters isn't prevented by default, but the input will
        display an error state. Number inputs come with increment/decrement
        buttons, but are otherwise not very useful.
      </p>
      <label for="email-input">email input</label>
      <input id="email-input" type="email" value="peanut@harvard.edu" />
      <p>
        Displays an error state if not a valid email address. If you navigate to
        another page in this directory, your browser might try to save these
        credentials for this website! Your browser looks for inputs with
        type="email" or type="password" to provide such conveniences.
      </p>
      <label for="password-input">password input</label>
      <input id="password-input" type="password" value="friends" />
      <p>
        Hides characters being typed. The value is still accessible in the DOM
        though.
      </p>
      <label for="date-input">date input</label>
      <input id="date-input" type="date" value="2012-12-21" />
      <p>
        Here's a fancy date picker that your browser provides to make it easier
        to enter date values
      </p>
      <label for="color-input">color input</label>
      <input id="color-input" type="color" value="" />
      <p>
        This one uses your Operating System's default color picker widget
      </p>
      <label for="file-input">file input</label>
      <input id="file-input" type="file" value="" />
      <p>
        Launches a native File Explorer window to select a file. The file chosen
        file isn't stored inside this element -- just a file path. And that file
        path also appears fake if you inspect it! Your browser shouldn't give
        random websites visibility into your computer's file system so it
        obfuscates this.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The blue <label>label</label> elements have a purpose too! A
        &lt;label&gt; provides a semantic hook for who or whatever is reading
        the document to understand the purpose of any &lt;input&gt;s, as their
        type and default value doesn't communicate much. They are used by screen
        reading technology like Apple voiceOver to aid in webpage accessibility
        -- how would you navigate an online form if the inputs weren't labelled
        and your eyes are no good?
      </p>
      <p>
        Another nice UX bonus: if you set the "for" attribute of a
        <label>label</label> (&lt;label for="Mitch"&gt;) to the same value of an
        id of an input (&lt;input id="Mitch"&gt;), clicking on that label will
        focus your keyboard on the corresponding input, or activate it if
        there's no keyboad interaction.
